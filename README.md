## Problem Objective
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming. Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning.

## DataSet Source:
The dataset is <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval" target="_blank">Credit Card Approval dataset</a> from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data consists of 16 columns and 160 records.

## Resources Used
**Python Version:** 3.7 </br>
**Packages Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
